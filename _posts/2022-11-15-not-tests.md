This was a great reminder for me:

> The commandments and covenants [The Savior] offers you are not tests to control you. They are a gift to lift you toward receiving all the gifts of God and returning home to your Heavenly Father and the Lord, who love you.

Henry B. Eyring, [Legacy of Encouragement](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/10/51eyring?id=p31&lang=eng#p31)
